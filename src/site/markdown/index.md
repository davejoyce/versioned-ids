# Introduction

Versioned IDs are namespace-aware identifiers that support simple value incrementation while storing a high degree
of information. They offer application developers an easy way to build complex, version-sensitive domain models
with strong IDs that are:

* Categorical
* Human-readable
* Incrementable
* Immutable
* Serializable
* Sortable
* Time-specific (to nanosecond)
